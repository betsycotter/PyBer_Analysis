# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Pyber, a ridesharing company, is our new employer. We have been tasked with analyzing data for the executive team. In this particular presentation, we have been asked to deliver insights into rides, drivers, and fares based on the city type from January 2019 to the end of April 2019. We are looking to see if there are differences between rural, suburban, and urban communities. Additionally, this information could help in making decisions about adding more drivers and service rates, including rates for underserved communities. 

## Resources:
- Data sources: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.12

## Results

We have created a summary of data by city type. This summary includes: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. See below for the results:

In this chart, one can see that the Urban rides were taken 2.6 times more than Suburban rides and 13 times more than Rural rides. The Urban cities have almost 5 times as many drivers as Suburban communities and almost 31 times more than Rural communities. As a result of more rides in Urban areas, the total fare data is much higher. However, when you calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver, the averages for Urban areas are the lowest of the three city types. 

Additionally, we analyzed the total fares by city type by week for January 2019 to the end of April 2019. See chart below:

As previously reported, the Urban cities have the highest total fares, followed by Suburban cities, and lastly Rural cities with the lowest total fares. In general, the city types followed a similar use pattern, with a few exceptions. 

## Summary

As a result of the analysis, we recommend the following: 
1. Researching peaks and valleys in the trend lines for each city type. Some of the fluctuations might occur because of weekends vs weekday activity or special events in the area. With the peaks, the company could implement peak price increase and with the valleys, the company could offer discounts. 
2. Recruit more drivers in the Suburban and Rural areas. This could help to increase total rides and total fares. If there are more drivers available, it could help riders obtain rides during peak times. 
3. Offer specials to the riders in the Suburban and Rural areas to increase total fares. While the profits may decrease, it could help for new riders to utilize the service, because there is an incentive.
